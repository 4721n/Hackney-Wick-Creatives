                    Using Black, White & Red as his favourite colour palette. Working with different types of street art media, STRA has been using stencil, wheat paste, stickers, collage, sculpture and murals as his weapons. Using the anagram of ARTS as his signature.

Yet living in a city that is so tolerant to art and culture he's found a more recent passion in painting in public spaces, feeding off of the interaction with passers by.

            <p> Abstraction has been the main performative character of graffiti evolution. Letters that evolve, create environments and go further than in a simple white canvas is what Juan2 does.
                <br><br>
                This Spanish graffiti artist possesses a very personal style. His pieces born from the original idea of graffiti, the letters, but transforming them into the main and unique character of his composition - always in a play between the wind and the waves, breaking to the coast of the wall.
                <br><br>
                Juan2 left his hometown, Alicante before his 20s - full of eagerness - focused on building a career in the art industry. Completed studies in Fine Arts, Graphic Design and Art Production, combining digital and manual drawing in the studio with painting on mural surfaces in the urban landscape. Since 2012, Juan2 is based in London where develops his career in photography post-production and continues - as a recreational pursuit - creating independent letters that dance all over the walls, canvases, paper supports, etc.
                <br><br>
                Juan2 has an own philosophy of life and how the art interacts with it. For him, art is tangible and intangible: it is something that can be created and touched, imagined, shared and overjoyed... but also, it is the way people live, understand and interpret life.
                <br><br>
                Close mentally your eyes, travel away from where your body is... imagine how the letters transform your time. Imagine how life is worth with them on it.</p>

                With a fascination of subjects that offer a window into infinity. Mainly, astronomy, consciousness, mycology and geometry. Turned painted, to express metaphorical findings. Baring a question for humanity’s true origin. The focus of Orbit’s work became Fungi. Spending 4 years studying Mushroom photography, mind blown by the living story of this sentient morphological being.
                <br><br>

                His Art work takes a look at the relationship humanity shares with Fungi, currently, historically and future bound. Studying mycologists like @PaulStamets, with real world scientific facts. After many hours listening to the likes of Terrance (R.I.P) and Dennis McKenna, now aiming to share this information with the general public. Truly informed of the success of Fungi, he is hoping one day humanity can learn to adopt these hyper smart ways of living, to live in balance with nature.

            <p> Art activities began as a graffiti writer in 1997. Developing a style based on knowledge gained as an urban artist and craft of his profession as a designer. Passion for both - street letters and typography evaluated to abstract geometric compositions. His walls can be seen around Poland, Taiwan, France, Germany, the United States and the United Kingdom.
                <br><br>
                About - I’m looking for vibration and rhythm, the play of line creating positive and negative space, searching for tonal balance through contrast and harmony. I believe abstraction it’s the closest form of visual art to the music world, as it has the ability to convey emotional or expressive feelings and ideas without reference to recognisable objective forms already existent in reality. I rely on my intuition while building the composition based on basic shapes. I like to keep it playful and treat the process as a form of meditation.</p>

        <div class="artist-write-up">
            <p> Frankie Strand is a British artist, living and working in London. Her artwork ranges from small intricate pencil drawings to large scale paintings that span entire buildings. Hugely inspired by natural and medical history, Frankie’s work is largely informed by time spent sketching specimens in museums and observing plants and wildlife during her travels across Asia.
                <br><br>
                Occasionally her work leans towards a darker side through the exploration of morbid and sinister themes. At other times, you could say quite the opposite - Frankie is known for creating colourful, dynamic and uplifting pieces.
                <br><br>
                During lockdown Frankie has turned her parents summerhouse into a garden studio, where she locks herself away, painting with gouache, making paper cut-outs and cards to post to friends.

            <p> I started painting in Hackney Wick in 1997 when he went to a local squatter rave.
                <br><br>
                Being a local boy at heart he headed back and resumed his artwork in Hackney Wick. After creating a few pieces, he began to bring other artists into the area including Teach, Diet, Oker and Skore , by the mid 2000's his artwork and influence had become prevalent.
                <br><br>
                He paints a traditional style of graffiti rather than street art. This traditional style of graffiti art is his passion, and he loves seeing his name out there on it in the Wick. For him Hackney Wick continues to be great breeding ground for creativity, and for the Wick he remains one of the key influences that make it what it is today.</p>
